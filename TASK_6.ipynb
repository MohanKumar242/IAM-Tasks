        "The aim of this task is to learn and practice how to manage user accounts, groups, and access controls in a Linux-based environment (Kali Linux), with a focus on creating user accounts, assigning them to groups, and configuring appropriate access control or ownership levels. This will help understand the principles of Identity Access Management (IAM) and secure user/group administration.\n",
