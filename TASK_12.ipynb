        "Aim:\n",
        "The aim of this lab is to develop a web application that uses the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) protocol for user authentication. The user will authenticate using Okta, a cloud-based identity management provider, by registering the web application as a SAML service provider (SP). This allows for Single Sign-On (SSO) functionality in the web application.\n",
        "\n",
        "Algorithm:\n",
        "1.\tOkta Account Setup:\n",
        "○\tSign up for an Okta account (if you don't have one already).\n",
        "○\tCreate a new SAML application in Okta to serve as the Identity Provider (IdP).\n",
        "2.\tRegister SAML Application in Okta:\n",
        "○\tGo to the Okta dashboard, select Applications, and click on Add Application.\n",
        "○\tChoose SAML 2.0 as the integration type and follow the instructions to register your web application as a Service Provider (SP).\n",
        "○\tIn Okta, configure your app’s SAML settings by specifying:\n",
        "■\tSingle Sign-On URL (the endpoint on your web application that will handle the SAML response).\n",
        "■\tAudience URI (SP Entity ID) (the identifier for your application as registered in Okta).\n",
        "■\tNameID format (e.g., email address or user ID).\n",
        "■\tAttributes (user attributes like email, username, first name, last name, etc.).\n",
        "3.\tSAML Configuration in Web Application:\n",
        "○\tIn your web application, configure the SAML Authentication Endpoint to handle requests for authentication.\n",
        "○\tThe application will need to receive the SAML response from Okta, validate it, and extract user information from the assertion.\n",
        "4.\tInitiate SAML Authentication:\n",
        "\n",
        "○\tWhen the user tries to log in, they are redirected to Okta’s login page for authentication (Identity Provider Initiated SSO).\n",
        "○\tOkta will authenticate the user, generate a SAML assertion (authentication response), and send it back to your web application.\n",
        "5.\tValidate SAML Assertion:\n",
        "○\tThe web application receives the SAML response from Okta at the specified Single Sign-On URL.\n",
        "○\tThe application validates the response, including checking the signature, ensuring the response is from Okta, and extracting the user’s details (e.g., email, user ID).\n",
        "6.\tSession Creation:\n",
        "○\tUpon successful validation, the application creates a user session and grants access to the authenticated user.\n",
        "7.\tLogout (Single Logout):\n",
        "○\tThe user can log out either from the web application or from Okta, depending on how Single Logout (SLO) is configured.\n",
        "○\tThe web application should handle the SAML logout request and send the user back to Okta to log them out of the session.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inputs:\n",
        "1.\tUser Inputs:\n",
        "○\tUser clicks on the \"Login with Okta\" button on the web application.\n",
        "○\tUser provides login credentials (username and password) to Okta during the authentication process.\n",
        "2.\tConfiguration Inputs:\n",
        "○\tSAML Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL: The endpoint on the web application where Okta sends the SAML response.\n",
        "○\tEntity ID (Audience URI): The identifier for the web application registered in Okta.\n",
        "○\tSAML Settings: Okta’s metadata configuration such as SSO URL, NameID format, and required attributes.\n",
        "3.\tOkta Configuration:\n",
        "○\tOkta will generate a SAML Signing Certificate and provide SAML Metadata that needs to be imported into your web application.\n",
        "\n",
        "Outputs:\n",
        "1.\tSuccessful Authentication:\n",
        "○\tA valid SAML response containing the user’s identity attributes (e.g., email, username) from Okta.\n",
        "○\tThe web application receives a SAML Assertion, validates it, and grants access.\n",
        "○\tThe user is logged in and granted access to the protected sections of the web application.\n",
        "2.\tFailure to Authenticate:\n",
        "○\tError messages in case of invalid credentials or issues with the SAML assertion (e.g., signature mismatch, expired token).\n",
        "\n",
        "Results:\n",
        "\n",
        "●\tSuccessful Authentication: The user is able to log in via Okta using SAML. Once authenticated, their user profile information is extracted from the SAML assertion, and a session is created for them on the web application.\n",
        "●\tUnsuccessful Authentication: If the authentication fails, Okta will send an error response, and the user will be notified of the issue (e.g., invalid credentials or access denied).\n"
