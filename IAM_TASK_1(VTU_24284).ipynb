        " Install and run the tomcat server and DB server and test whether the server is started and running.\n",
        "\n",
        "Aim:\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of this task is to install, configure, and run a Tomcat server along with a database server (such as MySQL or PostgreSL), and verify that both servers are up and running. After starting both servers, the objective is to confirm their functionality by accessing the Tomcat server and ensuring it can connect to the database server.\n",
        "\n",
        "Algorithm:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.\tInstall Tomcat Server:\n",
        "○\tDownload the latest version of the Apache Tomcat server from the official website (https://tomcat.apache.org/).\n",
        "○\tExtract the downloaded Tomcat package to a directory of choice (e.g.,\n",
        "/opt/tomcat or C:\\tomcat).\n",
        "○\tSet up environment variables, if required (e.g., CATALINA_HOME).\n",
        "2.\tInstall DB Server:\n",
        "○\tChoose and install a database server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).\n",
        "    \tFor MySQL, download and install it from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/.\n",
        "     \tFor PostgreSQL, download it from https://www.postgresql.org/download/.\n",
        "○\tSet up the database server and initialize the database service.\n",
        "3.\tConfigure and Start the Servers:\n",
        "   ○\tStart the Tomcat server by running the startup script (startup.sh on Linux/Mac or startup.bat on Windows).\n",
        "   ○\tStart the database server using its corresponding service manager (e.g.,\n",
        "service mysql start for MySQL or pg_ctl start for PostgreSQL).\n",
        "4.\tVerify Server Status:\n",
        "   ○\tAccess the Tomcat web interface by navigating to\n",
        "http://localhost:8080 in a browser to ensure the server is running.\n",
        "○\tConnect to the database server using a client tool (e.g., mysql -u root -p\n",
        "for MySQL or psql for PostgreSQL) to verify that the DB server is active.\n",
        "5.\tTest Database Connection:\n",
        "○\tCreate a test database and connect it to a web application running on Tomcat (for example, a simple Java servlet).\n",
        "○\tCheck if the application can successfully interact with the database (insert/select data) to confirm that both servers are properly connected.\n",
        "6.\tCheck Logs:\n",
        "○\tCheck the Tomcat logs (located in the /logs/ directory) and DB server logs for any errors or issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Inputs:\n",
        "●\tTomcat Server Download Link: URL of the Tomcat server.\n",
        "●\tDB Server Type: MySQL, PostgreSQL, or another DBMS.\n",
        "●\tSystem Requirements: Ensure the system meets the prerequisites for both the Tomcat server and DB server (Java for Tomcat, OS requirements for DBMS).\n",
        "●\tTest Database: Test database or schema (e.g., test_db).\n",
        "\n",
        "Outputs:\n",
        "\n",
        "●\tTomcat Server Status: Confirmation of Tomcat server running (e.g., successful HTTP response from http://localhost:8080).\n",
        "●\tDB Server Status: Confirmation that the database server is running (e.g., successful\n",
        "login to the MySQL/PostgreSQL CLI).\n",
        "●\tTest Database Connection: Result from a test script or servlet confirming successful interaction with the database.\n",
        "●\tLogs: Any errors or success messages logged by Tomcat and the DB server.\n",
        "\n",
        "Results:\n",
        "\n",
        "●\tTomcat Server Running: If the Tomcat server is successfully started and accessible via a web browser (i.e., http://localhost:8080), the result is successful.\n",
        "●\tDB Server Running: If the DB server is running and a connection can be\n",
        "established through the command-line or a GUI client, the result is successful.\n",
        "●\tSuccessful Database Connectivity: If the test application (e.g., a simple servlet) can interact with the database (insert data, retrieve data), then the servers are properly configured and working.\n",
        "\n",
        "If any server fails to start or does not respond as expected, the issue may lie in misconfiguration, firewall issues, missing dependencies, or incorrect server settings. In that case, refer to the respective log files for troubleshooting.\n"
